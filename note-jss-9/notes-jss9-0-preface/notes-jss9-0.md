# Preface

## Cornerstones of the text
Basic ideas that introduce software design:

### Object-orientation
- Via **object-speak**
  - I.e., all processing is spoken in object-oriented terms

### Sound programming practices
Students will learn:
- how to write *good software*, NOT "how to program"
  - (writing software is not a set of cookbook actions, a good program is more than a collection of statements)
- how to solve problems and implement good solutions
- basic software engineering techniques
  - (**Software Failure** vignettes demonstrate the pitfalls of not following sound practices)

### Example-based learning
Students learn by example.
- Fully implemented to demonstrate specific concepts
- Small, understandable examples paired with large, realistic ones
- Balance between graphics and non-graphics programs
- **VideoNotes** provide additional examples in live presentation

### Graphics and GUIs
- **Graphics Track** sections that define graphical implementation
- uses **JavaFX** API
  - preferred & fully-supported approach to Java graphics and GUIs
- integrated naturally in topic progression
- can be ignored

## Chapter Breakdown

### Chapter 1 | Introduction
Introductory material covered while students become familiar with development environment:

- Computer systems
    - basic architecture
    - hardware
    - networking
    - programming
    - language translation

- Java
    - program development
    - object-oriented programming

### Chapter 2 | Data & Expressions
Data and expressions in a Java program:

- Data types
    - Conversion between types
- Expression use to perform calculations
    - Reading user input (via the `Scanner` class)

### Chapter 3 | Using Classes and Objects
Using predefined classes and objects that are created from them.

Used to:
- Manipulate character strings
- Produce random numbers
- Perform complex calculations
- Format output

Also covers:
- Enumerated types

### Chapter 4 | Writing Classes
Basic issues writing classes and methods.
Topics include:

- Instance data
- Visibility
- Scope
- Method parameters
- Return types
- Encapsulation
- Constructors

Some of the involved topics are deferred/revisited in Chapter 6.

### Chapter 5 | Conditional and Loops
Decision-making using boolean expressions.
Additional topics covered:

- `if` statement
- `while` loop
- iterators
- `Scanner` class revisited
    - Additional input parsing
    - Reading text files
- `ArrayList` class

### Chapter 6 | More Conditionals and Loops
The rest of Java's conditional and loop statements.

- Conditional:
    - `switch`
- Loop:
    - `do`
    - `for`
    - for-each
        - To process iterators and ArrayList objects
     
### Chapter 7 | Object-Oriented Design
Reinforces and extends the coverage of issues related to the design of classes.

- Techniques for identifying & relating between classes and objects needed for a problem
- Static class members
- Interfaces
- Design of enumerated type classes
- Method design uses
- Method overloading

### Chapter 8 | Arrays
Extensive coverage of arrays and array processing.

- Nature of arrays as a low-level programming structure vs high-level object management
- Command-line arguments
- Variable-length parameter lists
- Multidimensional arrays

### Chapter 9 | Inheritance
Class derivations and concepts, such as:

- Hierarchies
- Overriding
- Visibility

### Chapter 10 | Polymorphism
- Binding and how it relates to polymorphism.
- Polymorphic references
    - How they're accomplished
        - Inheritance
        - Interfaces
- Sorting as polymorphism example
- Polymorphism design issues

### Chapter 11 | Exceptions
- Class hierarchy from the Java standard library used to define expressions.
- Creating exceptions
- Use of exceptions for input & output
    - Example that writes as text file

### Chapter 12 | Recursion
- Recursion
    - Concept
    - Implementation
    - Proper use
    - Examples demonstrating how recursion techniques make certain types of processing elegant

### Chapter 13 | Collections
Introduces the idea of the collection and it's underlying data structure.

- Abstraction revisited in Collection context
- Classic data structures
- Generic types
- Introduction to CS2 course

### Self-Review Questions and Answers
Review fundamental ideas and terms in the section via short-answer questions.
Answers found in Appendix N.

### Exersizes
Problems that require computation, analysis, or writing of code fragments, and a thorough grasp of the chapter content.

### Programming Projects
Problems that require design/implementation of Java programs.

### MyProgrammingLab

### VideoNotes
Explains topics visually through informal videos. Look for the VideoNotes icon within certain in-chapter topics and end-of-chapter Programming Projects.

### Software Failures
Between-chapter vignettes that discuss real-world flaws in software design for students to adopt sound design practices from the start.
